        <h3 id="about1">Reasonable Faith Singapore</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>Reasonable Faith is a Christian apologetics ministry established by Dr. William Lane Craig, Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and Professor of Philosophy at Houston Baptist University. He is a prolific defender of Christianity, having debated many notable atheists and non-Christians on university campuses globally. Dr Craig has authored or edited more than thirty books.</p>
        <p>Reasonable Faith aims to provide in the public arena an intelligent, articulate, and uncompromising yet gracious Christian perspective on the most important issues concerning the truth of the Christian faith today, such as:</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>the existence of God</li>
          <li>the meaning of life</li>
          <li>the objectivity of truth</li>
          <li>the foundation of moral values</li>
          <li>the creation of the universe</li>
          <li>intelligent design</li>
          <li>the reliability of the Gospels</li>
          <li>the uniqueness of Jesus</li>
          <li>the historicity of the resurrection</li>
          <li>the challenge of religious pluralism</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Reasonable Faith Singapore seeks to locally fulfil the three-fold mission of philosopher and theologian Dr. William Lane Craig's Reasonable Faith Ministry:</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>to provide an articulate, intelligent voice for biblical Christianity in the public arena</li>
          <li>to challenge unbelievers with the truth of biblical Christianity</li>
          <li>to train Christians to state and defend Christian truth claims with greater effectiveness</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>We aim to provide churches and ministries in Singapore apologetics resources and training through conducting courses, giving talks and holding discussions. Ultimately, the aim of the group is to glorify God and spread the Gospel through the use of apologetics.</p>
        <p>Christians are called to always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks us for the hope that we have (1 Peter 3:15). Apologetics, which is making a case for the truth of the Christian faith, is an expression of loving God with our mind. It strengthens the faith of believers and helps bring non-believers closer to accepting the Gospel.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><em>"The value of apologetics extends far beyond one's immediate evangelistic contact. It is the broader task of Christian apologetics to help create and sustain a cultural milieu in which the Gospel can be heard as an intellectually viable option for thinking men and women."</em></p>

        <h3 id="about2">Statement of Faith</h3>
        <br/>
        <ol>
          <li>We believe that the one and only God is tri-personal, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit being distinct, divine persons.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly human, the unique, sure, and sufficient revelation of the very being, character, and purposes of God, beside whom there is no other God, and beside whom there is no other name by which we must be saved.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that the only ground for our acceptance by God is what Jesus Christ did on the cross and what He is now doing through his risen life, whereby He exposed and reversed the course of human sin and violence, died for our sins, redeemed us from the power of evil, reconciled us to God, and empowers us with his life "from above." We therefore bring nothing to our salvation. We receive His redemption solely by grace through faith.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that new life, given supernaturally through spiritual regeneration, is a necessity as well as a gift and that the lifelong conversion that results is the only pathway to a radically changed character and way of life. Thus the only sufficient power for a life of Christian faithfulness and moral integrity in this world is that of Christ's resurrection and the power of the Holy Spirit.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that Jesus' own teaching and His attitude toward the total truthfulness and supreme authority of the Bible, God's inspired Word, make the Scriptures our final rule for faith and practice.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that being disciples of Jesus means serving Him as Lord in every sphere of our lives, secular as well as spiritual, public as well as private, in deeds as well as words, and in every moment of our days on earth, always reaching out as He did to those who are lost, as well as to the poor, the sick, the hungry, the oppressed, the socially despised, and being faithful stewards of creation and our fellow-creatures.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that the blessed hope of the personal return of Jesus provides both strength and substance to what the Church is doing, just as what we are doing becomes a sign of the hope of where we are going; both together leading to a consummation of history and the fulfilment of an undying kingdom that comes only by the power of God.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>We believe that all followers of Christ are called to know and love Christ through worship, love Christ's family through fellowship, grow like Christ through discipleship, serve Christ by ministering to the needs of others in his name, and share Christ with those who do not yet know him, inviting people to the ends of the earth and to the end of time to join us as his disciples and followers of his way.</li>

        <h3 id="about4">What is Apologetics?</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>Christians understand faith not as 'belief despite the lack of evidence', but rather as placing our trust in God. We believe in God, not merely believe that God exists. <strong>Christian apologetics is making a case for the truth of the Christian faith.</strong></p>

        <p><em>1 Peter 3:15 [ESV]: "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,"</em></p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Is Apologetics Biblical?</h4>
        <p>Jesus appealed to miracles and to fulfilled prophecy to demonstrate that His claims were true (Luke 24:25–27; John 14:11). The apostles used fulfilled prophecy, Jesus’ miracles, and especially Jesus’ resurrection to show that He was the Messiah (Acts 2). The apostles also sought to show the existence of God through His handiwork in nature (Acts 14:17, Romans 1:20), and eyewitness testimony of Jesus’ resurrection to show further that Christianity is true (1 Corinthians 15:3–8).</p>

        <br/>
        <h4>Why Is Apologetics Important?</h4>
        <p><strong>Shaping culture:</strong> The gospel is always heard against our cultural backdrop. Presenting arguments and evidence will help to create a culture in which Christian belief is seen as a reasonable option.</p>
        <p><strong>Strengthening believers:</strong> Knowing what and why we believe will make us more confident in sharing our faith. Apologetics can also help us to keep the faith in times of doubt and struggle. It reminds us that our faith is not based on emotions but on the truth, and therefore we must hold on to it.</p>
        <p><strong>Attracting seekers:</strong> We become a more effective witness by being equipped to give reasons for the hope within. We can also reach those who will respond to rational argument and evidence and turn to Christ. Such persons can have tremendous impact, such as C.S. Lewis and Lee Strobel.</p>

        <br/>
        <h4>How should we do apologetics?</h4>
        <p>One way is to use arguments, which are reasons that supports the case, consisting of one or more premises and a conclusion. An example is the moral argument:</p>
        <br/>
        <ol>
          <li>If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist.</li>
          <li>Objective moral values and duties do exist.</li>
          <li>Therefore, God exists.</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <p>Good apologetics involves “speaking the truth in love” (Ephesians. 4:15) and being gentle and respectful (1 Peter 3:15). We can present a defense of the Christian faith without becoming defensive. We can present arguments for Christianity without becoming argumentative.</p>

        <br/>
        <h4>What difference does it make if God Exists?</h4>
        <p>If God does not exist, life is without ultimate or objective meaning, value, or purpose.</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meaning</strong> has to do with significance, why something matters. We will die, and the universe will experience a heat death. Unless there is a transcendent God and eternal life, our lives have no objective meaning. While we can attempt to ascribe meaning, value or purpose to our lives, these are subjective illusions. Objective meaning can only come from a personal Creator who has endowed creation with meaning and significance.</li>
          <br/>
          <li><strong>Value</strong> has to do with good and evil, right and wrong. If life ends at the grave, we may as well just live as we please. Furthermore, without God, there is no foundation for objective moral values and duties.</li>
          <br/>
          <li><strong>Purpose</strong> has to do with a goal, a reason for something. Without God, life and everything that happens is ultimately purposeless, since the universe and Man simply came into existence due to a cosmic accident.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>While this does not prove that God exists, it underscores the predicament we face if we reject the existence of God.</p>
